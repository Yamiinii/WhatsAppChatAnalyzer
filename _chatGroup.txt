[10/01/25, 6:52:26 PM] Akash Gupta mtech: I understand your frustration regarding co-curricular credits, course clashes, bus issues, and other challenges. These concerns are valid, and as being PG Academic Secretary, I’ve worked hard to address them. Whether it was fighting for relaxed attendance policies, improving bus services, or introducing re-examinations.


We ( All Sec) have consistently taken up issues that impact you all. I’ve often stepped beyond my defined responsibilities, which has led to both successes and personal consequences, including disciplinary actions.
( VERY Few knows )



Regarding Nageshwar’s resignation, it reflects the immense pressure and challenges we face when the administration repeatedly ignores our efforts. It’s disheartening, but I assure you that we have always fought for your best interests.



I agree that we need fearless individuals like @919103101200 who can boldly advocate for students’ rights and which I think I did for the best of my knowledge and for your knowledge too if you forgot then.(Thank you so much ) ...😞 . 


Real change, however, requires collective effort. Together, we can amplify our voices and push for the improvements we need.

The administrative roadblocks we face show systemic issues that cannot be resolved single-handedly. While it may seem like inaction, we continue to push for change. 


Last but not least :

Your criticism is welcome, but so is your support. work together to build a stronger, united student community and tackle these challenges.

[17/01/25, 2:28:48 PM] raghav iit j jr: Dear Raghav,

I am Madhvika. I am a student of IIT Gandhinagar and also event executive of Blithchrone'25.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits.

We are excited to present *Dell'Arte* , the Improv Comedy event at *Blithchron* , IIT Gandhinagar's annual cultural fest. As we continue our tradition of laughs, surprises, and pure unscripted madness, we would love for you to be a part of this unforgettable experience!

This event is all about showcasing your creativity, wit, and ability to think on your feet. No scripts, no plans—just pure, spontaneous comedy!

Event Structure:
1.     *Preliminary Round (Online):* 
You'll try some simple improv games in this 10-15 minute online meeting. It’s a fun, casual way to get a feel for the event. Don’t stress! This round is about warming up and having fun, so no pressure!

2.     *First round:* 
In this round, you'll perform an impromptu comedy scene that shifts through four distinct comedic moods. The catch? You must hit all four quadrants—no skipping! The goal: keep the audience laughing while adapting quickly to each mood change.

3.     *Second round:* 
The final round is here! Teams will draw two chits—one for a background and one for a challenge. With these random elements, you’ll create a 3-4 minute comedy drama that will make the audience laugh, and wonder what just happened.

 *Please read the rulebook for more details.*

His financial condition is not that good.....he need some financial support. 
He is the only child of his parents.

As a part of this esteemed institute ( IIT JAMMU ) we should come forward in raising maximum money  possible.
We request our alumni to contribute as much as possible. 

We all might have different plans but your small help might help him out in making his life easier....!

His QR code along with his father's QRdetails are attached below .
If someone wants to see the reports then he / she can message me on the same number.

Agr maanlo india koi ai bnaata aur koi bnda pakistan me baith ke usse puuchta ki j&k ka kya status h to obvious si baat h vo india vaala ai india ke view ki tarf biased hota
China vaala deepseek to vaise views bhi ni dera koi apne
[30/01/25, 12:10:49 PM] Ranjeet Raj IIT J: Agar india ka AI pakistani ko bol raha hai it is an integral part of India then do you not think AI is giving the true information rather than narrative?
[30/01/25, 12:13:35 PM] ~ Jashan Sohi: Vo to india ka view h ki j&k is integral part of india 
China ka bhi view h taiwan is an integral part of china
Neutral or unbiased view hota ki jo pok h vo abhi pakistan me h aur ladakh ka kuch part china ke paas
Neutral and international sources me yhi maps use hote h

[30/01/25, 12:24:17 PM] ~ Vishwaroop Gangarde: @919430870599 Censorship is a thing in china, so we cant help with it. jbtk it is a China based company it has to follow there law
[30/01/25, 12:31:05 PM] Ranjeet Raj IIT J: Firstly it is not the only view of India that j&k is an integral part of India there are a lot of countries that agree with India's stand including usa,russia,japan,france, australia...etc and no country except pakistan has officially claimed that j&k is part of pakistan however china and turkey have supported the pakistan stance on j&k.
Secondly china claims that taiwan is part of China and one day they will merge taiwan with China .
And if the question is of neutral answer then you can check gpt is giving answer that pok and aksai chin is illegally occupied by pakistan and China and India claims that it is the part of the india.
And you can check the map of un which clearly shows pok and aksai chin as in India's part
[30/01/25, 12:33:16 PM] Ranjeet Raj IIT J: I agree and I'm also not supporting gpt I'm just saying that we should not trust ai answer blindly and should be aware of the fake narrative and propaganda

J&k disputed region me dikha rkha h agr dikhta ho achhe se with aksai chin and pok as part of china and pakistan
Or loc hi international border maana jaata h j&k 
Aur ek baat jaise hm pok ko sochte h ki vo illegally occupied h or jaise pakistan hmaare kashmir ko sochta h usme kuch farq h?
Or 1971 se pehle ROC yaani taiwan baithta tha un me PRC yaani china ki jagah or US bhi support krta tha roc ko to kya usse ground realities bdl gyi ki roc sirf ek island ko control krta tha naaki pure china ko
1971 ke baad us ke jb relation mainland china ke sath ache hue to usne PRC ko support kia un me seat ke lie
Aise hi aaj us ko india me fayda dikh rha h vo india ke claim ko support krta h pr isse ground realities me kuch farq ni pdhta ‎<This message was edited>

[22/02/25, 1:09:32 PM] ~ Abhay Singh: I know that many of you are often dissatisfied with the mess food and have complaints about it. However, the mess workers put in 15–17 hours of hard work every day to serve us.  

I believe we can do something to appreciate their efforts. Contributing *just ₹50–₹100* isn’t a huge amount, and if everyone donates the same, it will make a big difference.
