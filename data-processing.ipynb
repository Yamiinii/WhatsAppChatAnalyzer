I’ve often stepped beyond my defined responsibilities, which has led to both successes and personal consequences, including disciplinary actions.\\n( VERY Few knows )\\n\\n\\n\\nRegarding Nageshwar’s resignation, it reflects the immense pressure and challenges we face when the administration repeatedly ignores our efforts. It’s disheartening, but I assure you that we have always fought for your best interests.\\n\\n\\n\\nI agree that we need fearless individuals like @919103101200 who can boldly advocate for students’ rights and which I think I did for the best of my knowledge and for your knowledge too if you forgot then.(Thank you so much ) ...😞 . \\n\\n\\nReal change, however, requires collective effort. Together, we can amplify our voices and push for the improvements we need.\\n\\nThe administrative roadblocks we face show systemic issues that cannot be resolved single-handedly.

       " 'Akash Gupta mtech: I understand your frustration regarding co-curricular credits, course clashes, bus issues, and other challenges. These concerns are valid, and as being PG Academic Secretary, I’ve worked hard to address them. Whether it was fighting for relaxed attendance policies, improving bus services, or introducing re-examinations.   We ( All Sec) have consistently taken up issues that impact you all. I’ve often stepped beyond my defined responsibilities, which has led to both successes and personal consequences, including disciplinary actions. ( VERY Few knows )    Regarding Nageshwar’s resignation, it reflects the immense pressure and challenges we face when the administration repeatedly ignores our efforts. It’s disheartening, but I assure you that we have always fought for your best interests.    I agree that we need fearless individuals like @919103101200 who can boldly advocate for students’ rights and which I think I did for the best of my knowledge and for your knowledge too if you forgot then.(Thank you so much ) ...😞 .    Real change, however, requires collective effort. Together, we can amplify our voices and push for the improvements we need.  The administrative roadblocks we face show systemic issues that cannot be resolved single-handedly. While it may seem like inaction, we continue to push for change.    Last but not least :  Your criticism is welcome, but so is your support. work together to build a stronger, united student community and tackle these challenges. ',\n",

This event is all about showcasing your creativity, wit, and ability to think on your feet. No scripts, no plans—just pure, spontaneous comedy!  Event Structure: 1.     *Preliminary Round (Online):*  You'll try some simple improv games in this 10-15 minute online meeting. It’s a fun, casual way to get a feel for the event. Don’t stress! This round is about warming up and having fun, so no pressure!  2.     *First round:*  In this round, you'll perform an impromptu comedy scene that shifts through four distinct comedic moods. The catch? You must hit all four quadrants—no skipping! The goal: keep the audience laughing while adapting quickly to each mood change.  3.     *Second round:*  The final round is here! Teams will draw two chits—one for a background and one for a challenge. With these random elements, you’ll create a 3-4 minute comedy drama that will make the audience laugh, and wonder what just happened.   *Please read the rulebook for more details.*     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPGl-Pnh7V3Yb7UslErupDbEJalmKdkiaWtcfHfI9I0/edit?usp=sharing  Register here: https://forms.gle/cHaEnQDuQgbm9dd1A  If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out via email.

       " 'Akash Gupta mtech: I understand your frustration regarding co-curricular credits, course clashes, bus issues, and other challenges. These concerns are valid, and as being PG Academic Secretary, I’ve worked hard to address them. Whether it was fighting for relaxed attendance policies, improving bus services, or introducing re-examinations.   We ( All Sec) have consistently taken up issues that impact you all. I’ve often stepped beyond my defined responsibilities, which has led to both successes and personal consequences, including disciplinary actions. ( VERY Few knows )    Regarding Nageshwar’s resignation, it reflects the immense pressure and challenges we face when the administration repeatedly ignores our efforts. It’s disheartening, but I assure you that we have always fought for your best interests.    I agree that we need fearless individuals like @919103101200 who can boldly advocate for students’ rights and which I think I did for the best of my knowledge and for your knowledge too if you forgot then.(Thank you so much ) ...😞 .    Real change, however, requires collective effort. Together, we can amplify our voices and push for the improvements we need.  The administrative roadblocks we face show systemic issues that cannot be resolved single-handedly. While it may seem like inaction, we continue to push for change.    Last but not least :  Your criticism is welcome, but so is your support. work together to build a stronger, united student community and tackle these challenges. ',\n",
